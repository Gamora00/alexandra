        Hello, Alex! This is my personal message for you. I’m truly grateful that you came into my life. 
        Because of your kindness and your beautiful soul, I’ve found myself falling in love with you. Even though we haven’t met in person yet, I’m certain that you’re the girl I truly want. I wish I could take you on real dates, hold your hand, and get to know you face-to-face. For now, the distance keeps us apart, not forever, but just for now. You deserve a love that’s 
        never confusing, a love that’s genuine, and I want to be the one to give you that.
